# Buckyball Challenge

We use ·buckyballgenerator.py· to generator the buckyball, including edges, nodes and neighbors.

## Algorithms:

### 1. Tensor network
contraction2.m

tensor_product.m is the auxiliary function computing the tensor contraction.
### 2. Monte Carlo simulation

### 3. Wang-Landau Algorithm
